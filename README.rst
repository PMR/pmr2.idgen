pmr2.idgen - ID generator for PMR2
==================================

Plone by default does not provide a way to generate concise unique ids,
such as auto-increment identifiers.  This package addresses this issue
and is used to generate identifiers for PMR2 exposures.  Currently there
are three methods provided - random hexadecimal string, auto-increment 
in decimal or hexidecimal.
